PSEUDOCODE
What is Pseudocode?
Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of a computer program or algorithm. It is written in symbolic code which must be translated into a programming language before it can be executed.

It's a word version of a flow chart or decision tree https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-write-pseudocode-a-beginners-guide-29956242698

Why is Pseudocode?
Quite often you will need to discuss the logic and process of your code your pseudocode is the simplest form of this.
You can keep it next to you while you code, it helps you keep on track and can be very comforting.
How is Pseudocode?
Your pseudocode can be subjective and non-standard:

IF you are happy
   THEN smile
ENDIF
and this is our creative coding process in a nutshell... written in Pseudocode!

WHILE idea
  WHILE not pseudocode
    sketch/prototype
    write notes
    form pseudocode
  END WHILE
  PRINT "pseudocode is clear"
  CASE
    for web
        open sketch in P5js
     for MAC
        open sketch in Processing
     for Arduino
         open sketch in Python
  WHILE coding
    follow your pseudocode
    tinker
    test
    WHILE code doesn't work 
       look up references
       ask for help
       experiment
    END WHILE
    save variations  
  IF code > satisfactory
     upload to Github
  ELSE 
     schedule more time to work on code
  END IF
